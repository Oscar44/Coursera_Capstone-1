    "Drowning is one of the leading causes of death in children 0-4 years of age. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that drowning is the number one cause of death in one-, two- and three-year-old children (ABS 2019). Between 1 July 2002/03 and 30 June 2018/19, 496 children aged 0-4 years drowned in Australia. Of these, 202 (41%) children aged one year drowned – within the context of an entire lifespan, from 0 to 100 years, no other age is at greater risk of drowning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most deaths in children aged one occurred in backyard swimming pools (59%) and during the summer months (44%). Accidental falls into water was the leading activity prior to drowning in this age group, accounting for 88% of all deaths. Almost all of these deaths were due to a lack of active adult supervision. For every toddler drowning death approximately eight children are admitted to hospital as a result of non-fatal drowning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Royal Life Saving through their program, ***The Keep Watch program***, suggest four key drowning prevention actions: Supervise, Restrict Access, Water Awareness and Resuscitate. When implemented together, these safety measures can help to maximise child safety around water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core conviction of the above program is however, that the child is the most important part of a drowning prevention strategy, i.e., Water Awareness. Children are curious, capable, and have an uncanny ability to overcome obstacles like pool fences; Therefore preparing them water survival skills to potentially save themselves if they find themselves in the water alone, is indeed essential.\n",

    "The main objective of this report is to provide best estimation on where to open infant survival swim school based on the data from Australian Biro Statistic (ABS) website."
